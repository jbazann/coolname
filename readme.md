# ABOUT

This is the first big project I ever made, I wanted to build something fun, so I chose to play with audio processing. Turns out interacting directly with OpenGL and JavaSound wasn't fun at all, but at least I have an unlimited source of problems to solve. The current version simply plays an audio file in a loop, displaying its PCM data and frequency spectrum.

# TODO LIST

- Come up with a name that isn't cringe
- Make the interface pretty
- Put some cool numbers on the window to monitor things that are happening
- Fix all //TODO comments
- Fix all unwritten //TODO comments 8)
- Decide what to put in config files and what not to
- Build a screen to actually change the config files so that they make sense
- Record a video showing what this does (once it actually does something interesting)
- Read Java guidelines for things like where to use this. and when to use whitespaces and all that stuff to make code look pretty
- Plug a database and implement recording/editing functions
- Maybe eventually build a web interface and just use this as backend
- Come up with more fun stuff to do

# TODO SOON LIST

- Review all packages and polish the ugly things
- Fix DisplayWorker ignoring the 60Hz cap and find out if that's why everything starts lagging after a while
- If that's not it then cry for a while and find out why once I'm done crying
